#(18)What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. 


#A tuple is a collection data type in Python that is ordered and immutable. 
#  Tuples are used to store a fixed collection of items. They are similar to lists
#  but with some key differences. Tuples are defined by enclosing the items in
#  parentheses ( ), and each item is separated by a comma.

#list

#List are mutable
#The list is better for performing operation,such as insertion and delection.
# Lists consume more memory
# List have serval built-in methode.
# Unexpected change and eror and more likely to occur

# Tuple
 
# Tuples are immutable
# The implication data type is appropriate for accessing the element
# Tuples consume less memory as compared to the list
# Because tuples dont change they are far less error-prone.
